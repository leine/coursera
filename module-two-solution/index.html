			And all that he left was a small pile of rocks, with one word... UNLESS. Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess. But each day since that day I've sat here and worried and worried away. Through the years, while my buildings have fallen apart, I've worried about it with all of my heart.

			But now, says the Once-ler, Now that you're here,
			the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear. UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not. SO... Catch! calls the Once-ler. He lets something fall. It's a Truffula Seed. It's the last one of all!
